# Number Guessing
Number Guessing Games in Multiple Programming Languages


## Python
You will need to import a built-in module in python to generate random numbers: `import random`. 
<br>
Before that, you would require [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your machine.
</pre>
### How to Run
<pre>
<b>python3</b> numberGuessing.py
</pre>

## JavaScript
You will need to install an external module/dependency/library using the command `npm install prompt`. More info on the package can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt).
<br>
As a prerequisite, you would need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. 
### How to Run
<pre>
<b>node</b> numberGuessing.js
</pre>
**or**
<pre>
<b>node</b> numberGuessing
</pre>

## Swift
No extra dependencies are requied, apart from [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or [Swift](https://swift.org/download/) installed from its official website.
### How to Run
<pre>
<b>swift</b> numberGuessing.swift
</pre>

## C

## C#
You will need an IDE/Text Editor, preferably [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), not to be confused with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is also by Microsoft.
<br>
Before compilation, the following will also need to be imported:
```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
```
### How to Run
In **Microsoft Visual Studio** *(recommended)*,
<br>
press the run/play button and a terminal/command prompt would pop up. 
<br>
<br>
In **Another IDE** (e.g. Atom, Visual Studio Code) or directly from command line,
<br>
you may install relevant plugins and extensions, and initialise config files (VS Code), etc. and run using .NET Core, provided you have the required softwares downloaded.
